# in order to run the web, open the web package and make sure to run directly from it (cd web) and not from the project file youtubeProject.
- when you open the site, it takes you directly to the homepage, where you can see all the build in videos.
- if you enter a videView page as a guest, the only things you can do are watch- both the video and comments, with no option to edit or add.
- when you register, you get the option to delete, upload and edit any video. as well as add, adit and delete any comment.
- when signing up, if you dont choose a profile photo, you will get a default photo (our hemitube logo).
- you can see, that when you are not registered, the add video button an log out buttons are not displayed.
- also, when you are registered, you have to properly sign out before signing in as a different user.
- if you go back to homepage in the moddle of signin/signup process, you will simply go back to being a guest (and the attempt will be forgotten)
- you are not signed in/up until you complate the process appropriately.
- same about video adding
